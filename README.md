# Food Waste 

I recently learned that the Town of Cary releases its data on its Food Waste Collection initiative: https://data.townofcary.org/pages/food-waste-pilot-data-story/

I'd like to explore this data more to understand better how the initiative is going and possibly hypothesize its next steps.
